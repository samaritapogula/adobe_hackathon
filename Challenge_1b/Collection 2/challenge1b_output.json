At the end of this set of modules, you should have a rough draft of student learning out- comes that you can share with your colleagues and refine for the form. As a bonus, you will also have a rough draft of some innovations you can add to courses you may be teaching next year. Faculty who have been through this process report that they have discovered how to use class time more efficiently, their teaching has been re-invigorated, they actually look forward to class, and students seem to be learning better. learning outcomes. The CET&L and Ruth Benander created this set of modules so that you can work independently through the process. Sometimes called \u201cgoals\u201d and/or objectives the phrase \u201cstudent learning outcomes\u201d in this context refers to knowledge, skills, abilities, or attitudes that students should have achieved by the end of the course or a formal educational experience, ones that are both observable and measurable. The emphasis of student learning outcomes is on what students can do with what they have learned, resulting in a product that can be evaluated. How long will it take to complete? What are Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)? How will these modules help me? Stages of filling out the Semester-Conversion Form By Ruth Benander",

      "refined_text": "Student Learning Outcomes and Activities The Context: Now that you have identified what students should be able to do on their own when they leave your course, as well as how you will know if they really have mastered those abilities, the next consideration is how to help them achieve that mastery. You need to design activities that will help students learn to do the assessments you have designed. Lectures and readings are the traditional activities that we offer students to help them learn course con- tent which is then measured by papers and exams. We know that people learn better when they work to find the implications of what they are learning, apply the ideas, and practice the benefits of knowing the new information. Creating assignments that work with these ideas may feed directly into the learning outcomes you have identified. We also know that being actively engaged in the course content promotes retention of infor- mation, so it is interesting to consider how to help students solve complex problems with real data . Here are some sites that offer different types of strategies that you might consider.",
