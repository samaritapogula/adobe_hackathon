The Transport White Paper formulated concrete targets for urban transport to contribute to strategic global and European policy goals. 9 COM(2013) 913. 10 Rupprecht Consult, Guidelines. Developing and Implementing a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (2013); www.eltis.org/mobility-plans. 11 COM(2013) 913, p. 2. 1.1 What is a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan? Policy context Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning is Europe\u2019s de facto urban transport planning concept. The policy that facilitated its establishment has been systematically developed by European policy makers since 2005.8 Its most important milestone was the publication of the Urban Mobility Package at the end of 2013,9 where the European Commission defined in an Annex the concept of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. At the same time, the first version of the Guidelines was released.10 The Urban Mobility Package advocates \u201ca step-change in the approach to urban mobility\u2026to ensure that Europe\u2019s urban areas develop along a more sustainable path and that EU goals for a competitive and resource- efficient European transport system are met.\u201d11 It sketches out the guiding principles of the planning process and the topics to be addressed in a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. The concrete steps to be followed, practical guidance and good practices are contained in the Guidelines. Since the publication of the Urban Mobility Package, the concept of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans has been widely taken up across Europe and internationally. However, while the concept has proven to be sound and continues to be valid, the Guidelines were increasingly in need of updating. Therefore, this new version of the SUMP Guidelines is still based on the original concept (described in the next chapter), but the recommendations for preparing a SUMP have been updated considerably. Definition The following definition of a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan has been widely accepted in Europe and internationally: \u201cA Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan is a strategic plan designed to satisfy the mobility needs of people and businesses in cities and their surroundings for a better quality of life. It builds on existing planning practices and takes due consideration of integration, participation, and evaluation principles.\u201d A Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan is based on the following principles, which are described in more detail below: SECTION 1: The Concept of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans This section is an introduction to Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. It is intended for all readers with an interest in urban mobility, including decision makers and other mobility stakeholders who are not planning experts. \u278a Plan for sustainable mobility in the \u201cfunctional urban area\u201d \u278b Cooperate across institutional boundaries \u278c Involve citizens and stakeholders \u278d Assess current and future performance \u278e Define a long-term vision and a clear implementation plan \u278f Develop all transport modes in an integrated manner \u2790 Arrange for monitoring and evaluation \u2791 Assure quality",

Considering that the role of public transport has never been more crucial in urban areas facing multifaceted challenges such as rising costs of living, the need to preserve social cohesion, and the growing urgency to address climate change; Considering that public transport remains a key lever in addressing these challenges by offering a convenient, affordable, and sustainable mode of transport for millions of urban dwellers, peri-urban residents and tourists; Considering that the public transport sector is a key ally for urban authorities in achieving their ambitions in air quality, health, and climate, as it serves as an exemplary sector in terms of sustainability;",

The future of urban mobility in Europe depends on decisive and coordinated action across all levels of government. As Deputy Mayors of European cities and representatives of the public transport community, we stand united in our commitment to transform public transport systems into the backbone of sustainable, inclusive, and liveable cities. We call upon national and European policymakers to endorse this vision and to work with us in creating a greener, more equitable future for all. Together, we can make Europe\u2019s cities leaders in sustainable urban mobility, setting a global standard for accessible, innovative, and environmentally responsible public transport, ultimately leading the transition toward a future of zero-emission mobility.",

      "refined_text": "162 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABLE URBAN MOBILITY PLAN (2nd Edition) The CIVITAS SUMPs-Up SUMP Learning Programme 3 allowed small- and medium-sized cities to share knowledge and experiences through various activities. As a result of exchanges, Rivas-Vaciamadrid learned about the steps to select, prioritise, and describe measures and followed these to reorganise its public transport system. The SUMP working group in Kilkis referred to insights about stakeholder engagement, measure selection, monitoring, and evaluation to develop an effective implementation methodology. Ginosa plans to establish a SUMP working group, which would embed learning from the programme into the city\u2019s long-term strategies and thereby help foster a more sustainable Ginosa.

Modugno, Ginosa Municipality, Eleftheria Spanou, Kilkis Municipality, collected by ICLEI Image: Ana Dragutescu Ginosa, Rivas Vaciamadrid, Kilkis: Exchanging knowledge in a European learning programme for cities Rationale Before starting the work on the next generation of your Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, you should consider new challenges and solutions for urban transport and mobility in your city. You have already adapted and reviewed the process during its implementation, now you have the opportunity to stand back and take a more strategic view of how conditions and expectations have changed - in order to optimise the planning process and measure selection for the future. After identifying where you stand (Activity 12.1), you have to decide now where you want to go and which lessons learnt, solutions, and knowledge you want to take into the next cycle. Experience shows that each planning cycle helps to improve the expertise and to increase the effectiveness of the next planning round. A first analysis of challenges can influence the design of the new planning process and close the circle between the current and the new SUMP. Aims \u2022 Get prepared for the next planning round. \u2022 Reflect on experiences in the current planning cycle with a view to new challenges ahead. Tasks \u2022 Consider new challenges for the future (society, technology, transport system) that could have an impact on the planning cycle and the SUMP implementation. Especially new developments of technologies and data usage might lead to major changes in the near future (e.g. Mobility as a Service, automated driving, big data, shared mobility). \u2022 Identify how policies in other areas could create synergies with mobility policy (land use, energy, environment, economic development, social inclusion, health and safety). \u2022 Get prepared to develop the next generation of your Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan.

This gives hope to the next generation and provides a clear strategic and regulatory direction to Europe\u2019s industry and businesses. In parallel the EU has fostered digitalisation, the exchange and re-use of data, as well as new technologies. A lot of new legislation affecting the public transport sector has been passed in 2019-2024 and its implementation requires appropriate funding. The Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy (SSMS) and the EU\u2019s Urban Mobility Framework call for modal shift and more sustainable daily mobility. Now it is time for implementation! Let\u2019s make high-quality public transport a symbol of modern Europe!",
